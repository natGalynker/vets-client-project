Pet link!



Pet Link is an Application which connects owners to their pets. It allows them
to keep all their pets information in one place regardless of the kind of pet.
When the user is signed in they will have the ability to new pets, edit their
current one and view all their pets at the same time with their correlating petId.

As a pet-owner I want to add a new pet to my lis of pets
As a pet-owner I want my information to stay private
As a pet-owner I want to edit my pets information
As a pet-owner I want to check my pets medical history
As a pet-owner I want access to all my pets
As a pet-owner I want my pets information saved

The live application is here:

<!-- Plans for the Future:
The site will include a calendar which would allow owners to add important pet
appointments and dates like vet visits. It will allow the owner to book an a
ppointment through the calandar and edit/cancel events also.

The landing page will include a search field which would allow non-users and
users alike to seach by zipcode for nearby pet stores, vets, animal hospitals
and shelters. This would encourperate the usage of a 3rd-party-API
